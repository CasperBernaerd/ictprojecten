                <h2>The Culture of Hip Hop</h2>
                <p>
                    DJing & turntablism, MCing/rapping, breakdancing, graffiti art, and beatboxing are the creative outlets that collectively
                    make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic. Like the blues, these arts were developed by African American communities
                    to enable people to make a statement, whether political or emotional and participate in community activities.
                    These practices spread globally around the 1980s as fans could "make it their own" and express themselves in new and creative ways in music,
                    dance and other arts.

                        DJing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph
                        turntables (or other sound sources, such as tapes, CDs or digital audio files) and a DJ mixer that is plugged into a PA system.
                        One of the first few hip hop DJs was Kool DJ Herc, who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation and extending of "breaks"
                        (the parts of albums that focused solely on the percussive beat). In addition to developing Herc's techniques, DJs Grandmaster Flowers,
                        Grandmaster Flash, Grand Wizzard Theodore, and Grandmaster Caz made further innovations with the introduction of "scratching",
                        which has become one of the key sounds associated with hip hop music.

                        Rapping (also known as emceeing, MCing, spitting (bars), or just rhyming) refers to "spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment".
                        Rapping typically features complex wordplay, rapid delivery, and a range of "street slang", some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture.
                        While rapping is often done over beats, either done by a DJ, a beatboxer, it can also be done without accompaniment. It can be broken down into different components,
                        such as "content", "flow" (rhythm and rhyme), and "delivery".Rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music.
                        The use of the word "rap" to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form. MCing is a form of expression that is
                        embedded within ancient African culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common within the Afro-American community.

                        Breaking, also called B-boying/B-girling or breakdancing, is a dynamic, rhythmic style of dance which developed as one of the major elements
                        of hip hop culture. Like many aspects of hip hop culture, breakdance borrows heavily from many cultures, including 1930s-era street dancing,
                        Brazilian and Asian Martial arts, Russian folk dance,[108] and the dance moves of James Brown, Michael Jackson, and California funk. Breaking
                        took form in the South Bronx in the 1970s alongside the other elements of hip hop. Breakdancing is typically done with the accompaniment of
                        hip hop music playing on a boom box or PA system.

                    <h2>4. Graffiti art</h2>

                        Graffiti is the most controversial of hip hop's elements, as a number of the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti
                        to be an element of hip hop. In America in the late 1960s, graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists.
                        Gangs such as the Savage Skulls, La Familia, and Savage Nomads used graffiti to mark territory.
                        One of the most common forms of graffiti is tagging, or the act of stylizing your unique name or logo.Spray painting public property or the property of
                        others without their consent can be considered vandalism, and the "tagger" may be subject to arrest and prosecution for the criminal act. Whether legal or not,
                        the hip hop culture considers tagging buildings, trains, bridges and other structures as visual art, and consider the tags as part of a complex symbol system
                        with its own social codes and subculture rules. Such art is in some cases now subject to federal protection in the US, making its erasure illegal.
                        Bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the Bronx, though the elaborate Brooklyn style Tracy 168 dubbed "wildstyle" would come
                        to define the art.The early trend-setters were joined in the 1970s by artists like Dondi, Futura 2000, Daze, Blade, Lee, Fab Five Freddy, Zephyr,
                        Rammellzee, Crash, Kel, NOC 167 and Lady Pink.
                        The relationship between graffiti and hip hop culture arises both from early graffiti artists engaging in other aspects of hip hop culture,
                        Graffiti is understood as a visual expression of rap music, just as breaking is viewed as a physical expression.

                        Beatboxing is the technique of vocal percussion, in which a singer imitates drums and other percussion instruments with her or his voice.
                        It is primarily concerned with the art of creating beats or rhythms using the human mouth.As it is a way of creating hip hop music,
                        it can be categorized under the production element of hip hop, though it does sometimes include a type of rapping intersected with the human-created beat.
                        It is generally considered to be part of the same "Pillar" of hip hop as DJing—in other words, providing a musical backdrop or foundation for MC's to rap over.
