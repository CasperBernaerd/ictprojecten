                <h1>History of Hip-Hop</h1>
                <h3>Origin of the term</h3>
                <p>
                    The creation of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy,
                    rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. However,
                    Lovebug Starski, Keith Cowboy, and DJ Hollywood used the term when
                    the music was still known as disco rap. It is believed that
                    Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined
                    the U.S. Army, by scat singing the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way
                    that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy
                    later worked the "hip hop" cadence into a part of his stage performance
                    , which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in
                    "Rapper's Delight".Universal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa
                    is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in
                    which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was
                    a derogatory term to describe the type of music. The first
                    use of the term in print was in The Village Voice, by Steven
                    Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.

                <p>
                    Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music,
                    is a music genre developed in the United States
                    by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s
                    which consists of a stylized rhythmic music
                    that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic
                    and rhyming speech that is chanted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It developed as part of hip hop culture,
                    a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements:
                    MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables,
                    break dancing, and graffiti writing.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines
                    from records (or synthesized beats and sounds),
                    and rhythmic beatboxing.

                        Earl Tucker (aka Snake Hips), a performer at the Cotton Club,
                        invents a dance style similar to today’s hip-hop moves.
                        He incorporates floats and slides into his dance.
                        Similar moves would later inspire an element of hip-hop culture known
                        as breakdancing.

                        Wong also utilizes hip American records to steal music-lovers from competitors and local bands.

                <h3>New school hip hop</h3>
                <p>
                    New school hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music,
                    originating in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C.
                    and LL Cool J. The Golden age hip hop period was an
                    innovative period between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s.
                    Notable artists from this era include the Juice Crew,
                    Public Enemy, Eric B. & Rakim, Boogie Down Productions and KRS-One,
                    EPMD, Slick Rick, Beastie Boys, Kool G Rap, Big Daddy Kane,
                    Ultramagnetic MCs, De La Soul, and A Tribe Called Quest.
                    Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that often focuses
                    on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city
                    African-American youth. Schoolly D, N.W.A, Ice-T, Ice Cube,
                    and the Geto Boys are key founding artists, known for mixing
                    the political and social commentary of political rap with the
                    criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap.
                    In the West Coast hip hop style, G-funk dominated mainstream
                    hip hop for several years during the 1990s with artists such
                    as Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg. East Coast hip hop in the early to
                    mid 1990s was dominated by the Afrocentric jazz rap and
                    alternative hip hop of the Native Tongues posse as well as
                    the hardcore rap of artists such as Mobb Deep, Wu-Tang Clan,
                    and Onyx. East Coast hip hop also had gangsta rap musicians
                    such as the Notorious B.I.G. and Lil' Kim.

                        In the 1990s, hip hop began to diversify with other regional
                        styles emerging, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop.
                        At the same time, hip hop continued to be assimilated into other
                        genres of popular music, examples being neo soul (e.g.: Lauryn Hill,
                        Erykah Badu) and nu metal (e.g.: Korn, Limp Bizkit). Hip hop became
                        a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the top selling music
                        genre by 1999. The popularity of hip hop music continued through
                        the 2000s, with hip hop influences also increasingly finding their
                        way into mainstream pop. The United States also saw the success
                        of regional styles such as crunk (e.g.: Lil Jon & the East Side
                        Boys, the Ying Yang Twins), a Southern genre that emphasized the
                        beats and music more than the lyrics. Starting in 2005, sales of
                        hip hop music in the United States began to severely wane.
                        During the mid-2000s, alternative hip hop secured a place in
                        the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists
                        such as OutKast and Kanye West. During the late 2000s and
                        early 2010s, rappers such as Lil Wayne, Soulja Boy, and B.o.B
                        were the most popular rappers. During the 2010s, rappers such
                        as Drake, Nicki Minaj, J. Cole, and Kendrick Lamar all have been
                        extremely popular. Trap, a subgenre of hip hop, also has been
                        popular during the 2010s with hip hop artists and hip hop music
                        groups such as Migos, Travis Scott, and Kodak Black.
