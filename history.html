        <h1>The History of Hip Hop: 1925 to Now</h1>
        <h3>Origin of the term</h3>
        <p>
          The creation of the term hip hop is often credited to Keith Cowboy, rapper with Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. However, Lovebug Starski, Keith Cowboy, and DJ Hollywood used the term when the music was still known as disco rap. It is believed
          that Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army, by scat singing the words "hip/hop/hip/hop" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of soldiers marching. Cowboy later worked the "hip hop" cadence into
          a part of his stage performance , which was quickly used by other artists such as The Sugarhill Gang in "Rapper's Delight".Universal Zulu Nation founder Afrika Bambaataa is credited with first using the term to describe the subculture in which
          the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe the type of music. The first use of the term in print was in The Village Voice, by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hip hop music, also called hip-hop or rap music, is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech
          that is chanted.
        </p>

        <p>
          It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing.

            Earl Tucker (aka Snake Hips), a performer at the Cotton Club, invents a dance style similar to today’s hip-hop moves. He incorporates floats and slides into his dance. Similar moves would later inspire an element of hip-hop culture known as breakdancing.
